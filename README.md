The receptionist for InstaStyle Medspa walked out and now the stylists have to take turns being the receptionist! Not only do they schedule their own appointments, but they also have to schedule appointments for their fellow stylists! They have asked me (their software developer) to create a web app where they can sign up/log in and create, retrieve, update, and delete appointments for their clients. Not only will this web application have CRUD capabilities for the appointments model but the stylist (user) can also make appointments for existing clients in the database or create new ones. The same is true for the service. 

	Thank you for joining me to experience the web application I have created for the stylists.  Here's how it works, to get started:

		-Run 'bundle' in terminal to download the gems needed to run the application. 
		-Open the server by typing 'rails s' in the terminal.
		-Open the web browser and type in http://localhost:3000 and the web application will load.
		-Create an account and help the stylists make appointments for their medspa already! As you will see, their existing clients are quite needy!
